# Online Shoppers Intention Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Online Shoppers Intention Dataset**, which focuses on user sessions and their impact on revenue generation. The dataset contains details like **page visits, time spent, user type, and session information**, which help predict whether a user will generate revenue.

## Project Goals
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns in user behavior.
- **Preprocess data** by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
- **Train multiple machine learning models** to predict purchase intentions.
- **Evaluate model performance** using classification metrics.
